As a computer science student, I've faced a numerous coding problems that have greatly contributed to my academic development. 
This code, which simulates rolling dice and adding up the results while dropping the lowest value, may seem simple, 
but was essential in helping me improve my programming abilities. This code uses pointers which is a key feature in C programming 
that allows direct memory manipulation and efficient data handling. For me personally, it took some time throughout the CMPT 251 class 
to fully understand pointers and how to use them within my own code.  But this dice-rolling code provided a useful setting for implementing 
and strengthening the use of pointers. In the "diceRoll" function, the "int *dice" parameter is a pointer to an integer array, 
which is how pointers are created in C to pass and manipulate data. I truly began to understand how pointers work and this was a crucial turning 
point in my development not only as a computer science student but as a C programmer too. Another learning experience that took place 
through this particular assignment but also throughout the entire class of CMPT 251 was the use of the Linux command line. I learned a 
lot about the process of compiling and running programs, which are essential elements of software development. I think this assignemnt meets many 
of the learning goals for the University and for the computer science department. Critical thinking and creativity were definetely a huge part for this piece of
code.
