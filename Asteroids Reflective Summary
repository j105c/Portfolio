Creating the Asteroids game in CMPT 202 was one of the first major projects that we did in the Computer Science major track. The goal of the class 
was to better understand data structures and we used a lot of array lists in this assignment. We also learned a lot about and used polymorphism to create 
asteroids and even the spaceship froma basic java class, shape.java. Polymorphism is essentialÂ because it makes code flexible and reusable.  
The code is made simpler, which makes it easier to comprehend and maintain. It also encourages scalability and makes it possible to 
add new features without altering existing code. This was an early project that allowed me to truly visualize the things we were building. Some assignemts would not go very deep,
where as this one, we spent weeks working on the final product. This assignment definetely allowed me as a student to practice creativity, crital thinking, collaboration,
understanding of the concepts and techniques of software design, acquiring significant project experience working both individually and in a group setting, 
developing effective problem solving skills, and attaining a system-level understanding of the computer.
